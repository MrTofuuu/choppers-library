## Description

Choppers library is so big that he needs to have an application to search for books.

### **Tasks completed**

Created a book search application using GraphQL, Node.js, and React.js

## User Story

I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I load the search engine
THEN I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button
WHEN I click on the Search for Books menu option
THEN I am presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button
WHEN I am not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button
THEN I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site
WHEN I click on the Login/Signup menu option
THEN a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up
